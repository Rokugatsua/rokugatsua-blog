# Unity with Vim or terminal editor

## Background Problem

I develop some a game prototype project with an Unity Engine. and i use amd-a9 with 4GB of ram as my main laptop.
the first i use the recomended enviroment to develop on unity. which is use VSCode with
Devkit extension and unity plugin. for detail i use linux with xfce and the unity version is 2022LTS.
well my laptop crash. yes, repeatly i try open project then not longer after that will crash.

my first solution is use omnisharp plugin in VS Codium. then i can develop my game but the crash still appear
if i doing to fast. simply because i write code same time with unity compile the c# or i accidentally switch with `alt`+`tab`.

next solution for me is to use vim. i use vim to edit linux config file, some thing like samba config and bashrc.
so let's screw it.

then, i gave up at first. because i don't know how it doesn't work. i installed the nvim.coc with omnisharp-vim. not work.

then, i install nvim and use kickstart-nvim. then i try to add omnisharp with lazy.nvim. i don't understand.

## the first light
after hours to try something with omnisharp thing and search on internet. the first solution come out.

if using Nvim. then you use kickstart-Nvim. then just install omnisharp with mason-plugin

1. on Normal mode of nvim typing the `:Mason`
2. navigate with `j` to **down** and `k` to **up**
3. on omnisharp line then press `i` to install
4. wait for finish, try navigate to top page, to see the installing process.

try to quit nvim if omnisharp not running.

## Unity side

after installed omnisharp on nvim. then i can code. 

but if i want to see my other project or new project then the omnisharp not shown.

this because, you must generate sln file and update visual code packed.

try do this:
- update visual studio package on unity package manager to recent.
- open prereference window. Edit>Prerefrence>external tools
- select visual studio code as code editor
- generate project file.

Note: try not to give checklist while generate project file. this because omnisharp will have more process then making crash your laptop.

## Vim light

i lose hope to use vim as unity code editor. but i meet this code

`let g:OmniSharp_server_use_net6=1`

yes this code i need to run with my installed dotnet on linux. OMG why i don't realize.
then i have vim intellisense worked. but sometime omnisharp have to mush time to recognize unity code. event not shown at all.

## helix 
i on terminal editor hoping now. i meet helix and i try. i kinda like it. but setting omnisharp LSP is hard too.

but i can use it. the trick is.
- download OmniSharp-Roslyn for net6
- extract it
- add to `PATH`

there you go.

## conclusion

the hours i spend to use omnisharp work in my code editor. i realize intellisense on code editor need `lsp` to be runnig out of the box.
i know lsp stand for Language Server Program. a program can give feedback of recomendation of language while writing some code.

- if you using Mason. then you must install omnisharp on Mason package
- if you using omnisharp-vim and use dotnet to run c# program don't forget to add 
`let g:OmniSharp_server_use_net6=1` on your .vimrc and run `:OmniSharpInstall` on vim.


## Trivia
is copilot an advance program of LSP?. i mean they kinda same.
